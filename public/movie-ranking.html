 <h1>Faryn's Favorites</h1>
 <h2>These are <i>Faryn-away</i> the most brilliant works of art!</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</h3>
 <p>A cinematic masterpiece. Deeply thought-provoking, and sure to reveal new hidden gems on every rewatch.</p>
 <h3>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</h3>
 <p>Okay, so this one isn't drop-dead amazing, but it's a personal favorite because of how well it brings a book to life. As a neurodivergent youth with a special interest of C.S. Lewis, I walked out of the theater after this film, and my only critique was that "Jadis' hair should be black." I'm still waiting for them to try and reconcile that issue if they ever make The Magician's Nephew. Tilda Swinton is awesome, but she's pretty obviously not from a hot arid desert kingdom.</p>
 <h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
 <p>...or really any Miyasaki film. They're all full of slice-of-life magic.</p>
 <h3>Cinco Amigas</h3>
 <p> In my opinion, this is the peak of 90s girl band filmography. I love the music and the characters and the world of the thing.</p>
 <h3>Danger in the Manger 2</h3>
 <p> This is such campy British b-movie fodder and I love it. Also, it has <i>two David Tennants</i> and really, that's all you need to know.</p>
 <h3>Red, White, and Royal Blue</h3>
 <p> Brilliant and gay and political; that is all.</p>
 <h3>Single All the Way</h3>
 <p>This a fabulous Christmas romcom, while also flipping some tired tropes on their heads. And...<i>MARY.</i></p>
