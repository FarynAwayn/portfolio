<h2>Amateur Dabbler</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Faryn! That's pronounced like the opposite of "Far out!"</p>
<p>Got that? Eh, don't worry. I hear it mispronounced all the time and I'm <i>fairin'</i> just fine.</p>
<p>I'm learning to code because, well, I can! It is fascinating, and I'm beginning to see why so many neurospicies relate to computer syntax in some way. (Oh yeah. The ADHD is strong with this one.)</p>

<p>My some-time creative hobbies include crocheting, knitting, painting, calligraphy, quilling, sewing, collaging, writing, playing flute, singing, ...and now coding!</p>

<h2>Professional Emotional Support Critter</h2>

<p>When I'm trying to actually get paid for things, I am a licensed pastor in The United Methodist Church. I currently serve as a resident chaplain at St. Anthony's Hospital North. 
  A chaplain is kind of like a therapy animal, except that we can talk (and ask great questions for self-reflection!) and you can't pet us.<p>
    
  </p>I am also faculty with 
  <a href="https://rebekahsimonpeter.com/">Creating a Culture of Renewal</a>, a ministry leadership development program. I am also the cofounder of 
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fearlessfutureselfdefense">Fearless Future</a>, a holistic self-defense program that empowers people in body, mind, and soul, designed with trans- and gender-expansive folx in mind. I also work as a merchandiser, but you really don't need to hear more about that.

<p>Unless you do? That would be cool. Were you, also, the type of child who would pour thousands of pony beads out on their bedroom floor for the joy of sorting them? If that's seriously you, then we need to talk! Come on over to my 
  <a href="./contact.html">contact page</a> and let's connect! (Less OCD folx are also welcome to get in touch!)
